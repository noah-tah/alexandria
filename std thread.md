The class `thread` represents [a single thread of execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing) "enwiki:Thread (computing)"). Threads allow multiple functions to execute concurrently.

Threads begin execution immediately upon construction of the associated thread object (pending any OS scheduling delays), starting at the top-level function provided as a [constructor argument](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/thread "cpp/thread/thread/thread"). The return value of the top-level function is ignored and if it terminates by throwing an exception, [std::terminate](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/terminate "cpp/error/terminate") is called. The top-level function may communicate its return value or an exception to the caller via [std::promise](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/promise "cpp/thread/promise") or by modifying shared variables (which may require synchronization, see [std::mutex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex "cpp/thread/mutex") and [std::atomic](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic "cpp/atomic/atomic")).

`std::thread` objects may also be in the state that does not represent any thread (after default construction, move from, [detach](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/detach "cpp/thread/thread/detach"), or [join](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/join "cpp/thread/thread/join")), and a thread of execution may not be associated with any `thread` objects (after [detach](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/detach "cpp/thread/thread/detach")).

No two `std::thread` objects may represent the same thread of execution; `std::thread` is not [CopyConstructible](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/CopyConstructible "cpp/named req/CopyConstructible") or [CopyAssignable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/CopyAssignable "cpp/named req/CopyAssignable"), although it is [MoveConstructible](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/MoveConstructible "cpp/named req/MoveConstructible") and [MoveAssignable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/MoveAssignable "cpp/named req/MoveAssignable").
