```

#cpp
# Difference between passing a pointer into a function and a structure into a function

---
thats weird so we pass a structure that already exists into a function as a pointer, because this way it can modify the original structure without creating a full copy of the object. this uses less resources and makes it to where we actually modify the original structure instead of a copy of the structure. am i understanding this correctly?
