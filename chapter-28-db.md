What social changes took place in the United States after World War II? What role did the war play in those changes? What do you believe were the most important changes to occur?


After World War II, there were several social changes that took place, such as suburbanization of cities through the production and sale of prefabricated homes in communities called Levittowns, which grew the suburbs by 46 percent which was an easy transition due to the low-interest mortgages offered by the GI Bill. I would say the main impact Levittowns had socially was how it not only encouraged, but required Americans to purchase automobiles in order to commute from their community to their place of work. This influx of automobiles stressed the state's highway infrastructure which resulted in the need to expand roads and highways with the taxes gained from the sale of gasoline. This suburbanization also created a gap in the market for convenience stores, restaurants, movie theatres to take root near highways to serve hungry and bored Americans on the go. The war also played a major role in the vast expanse of suburbanization with the passing of the G.I. Bill. This bill included every honorably discharged veteran who took part in active duty, not only gave qualifying veterans a year's worth of unemployment and paid for them to attend college with tuition assistance and a stipend, but also provided them with lower interest rates on their mortgages.

I think that suburbanization combined with the G.I. bill created the most important changes in the United States after World War II. This is because suburbanization encouraged the mass production and sale of the automobile, which forced states to build more highway infrastructure which allowed for businesses to capitalize on the resulting traffic, which changed American consumerism forever. Furthermore, the G.I. bill not only stimulated the market to encourage suburbanization, but it also encouraged qualifying veterans to return to school in the pursuit of education, which I believe has had a generational impact in the United States.
