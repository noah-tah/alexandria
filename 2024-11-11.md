So to implement more features into my c++ server i want to parse http requests

How do i make http requests with my browser?
	You can send different types of reqquests by entering different URLS or using browser tools like the developer console.

```
ROOT URL 
https://localhost:8080/

specific page
http://localhost:8080/about

```
