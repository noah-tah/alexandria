	Mesopotamia 
	Levant
	Parts of Byzantine Empire

Transition of power wasn't easy

Ibn Ishaq
	Arab Historian who Documented 30 years of human drama 
	most work has been lost
		scholars and historians quoted and summarized it thankfully
	

Muhammad Ibn Jarir  Al-Tabari
	9th century Persian scholar
	- created History of the Prophets and Kingjkj
		- 39 volume chronology from biblical figures to ancient empires al the way back to 915 ad



Ali's justification for being elected to be Caliphe
	Ali thought he was supposed to be the first to be leader after Muhammad because Ali Talib (Ali's father) adopted Muhammad as a son, which essentially made Muhammad and Ali brothers.
		- There was a 30 year difference between Muhammad and Ali, and in Arab culture, such a large gap in age between brothers signified that the older sibling is to act as a parental figure, which essentially made Ali the son of Muhammad by this logic, especially since Ali grew up in his household.
		- Considered to be the right-hand man of Muhammad
		Sermon of Ghadir al-Khumm
			"Of whomsoever I had been Mawla (Patron), Ali here is to be his Mawla. O Allah, be a supporter of whoever supports him (Ali) and an enemy of whoever opposes him and divert to Truth to Ali."
			- Since Islam did not believe in Dynastic succession  
				- These ties to the prophet are the things that they were trying to prevent from happening to keep Islam from becoming an aristocracy.

They split into to different sects of Islam

Succession to Muhammad
	Ali (Shia Islam)
		Muhammad's lineage
		Considered the right-hand man of Muhammad
	Abu Bakr (Sunni Islam)
		Elected as the Caliphe
		Dynastic succession is not Islamic

Tribes had disagreements with the Zakat they paid, and they felt that they only pledged allegiance to Muhammad himself
	Zakat
		charity tax that the tribes paid to the treasury of Medina
	Some tribal leaders even self-proclaimed themselves as new prophets
	Abu Bakr responded by establishing a new religious doctrineA
		"if there is only one God, then there must only be one embodiment of Islam, One community, one Ummah"
		"One Ummah under One God"
		As time went on this became a social pollical system and begun the Politization of Islam
	Those who rebelled against Abu Bakr were quickly crushed by Abu Bakr's primary Commander and Military Advisor
		ended first civil war called reader wars

The Arabian peninsula was bordered right next to the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanid Empire, and since they would eventually attack, Abu Bakr initiated an attack first.

When Abu Bakr was about to die, he nominated his military advisor, Umar, to be Caliphate
	This was controversial because Umar and Abu Bakr were very different.
		Abu Bakr remained very poor and humble
		Umar. was known as a drinker and a brawlers, and had a temper and towered over people
			Ali endorsed Umar, so Umar was elected.

Hasan "The Chosen"
	The Second Imam


# History of Islam, Part 5 of 5: Legacy of Hasan and Husayn


 Hasan-Muawiyah Treaty
	 Authority should be for Imam Hassan after Muawiya, and if an accident occurs, authority should go to Imam Hussain, Muawiya has no right to entrust authority to anyone

Hasan "The Peacemaker"
	The Second Imam

Muawiya was crowned as Caliph and gave a speech
	"I have desired the way followed by Abu Bakr and Umar, but I was unable to follow it, and so I have followed a course with you which contains fortune and benefits for you despite some bias, so be pleased with what comes to you from me even if it is little. When good is continuous, if it is little, it enriches. Discontent makes life grim."

Hasan died "mysteriously"
	Muawiya elected his son to rule instead now that the Hasan-Muawiyah Treaty was essentially useless


On Muawiya's deathbed he said:
	As for Husayn what can I tell you concerning him? Be careful not to confront him except in a good way. Extend to him a free hand (literally, a long rope) and let him roam the earth as he pleases. Do not harm him, yet show him the thunder and lightening (of your anger). Never confront him with the weapons of war but rather bestow upon him generous gifts. Give him a place of honor near you and treat him with due reverence. Be careful O my son, that you do not meet God with his blood, lest you be amongst those that will perish."

Husayn gave a final sermon as he left for Kufa to overthrow Muawiya with a small amount of troops
	The death is a certainty for mankind, just like the trace of necklace on tKhe neck of young girls. And I am enamored of my ancestors like eagerness of Jacob to Joseph ... Everyone, who is going to devote his blood for our sake and is prepared to meet Allah, must depart with us.

 Husayn became "Master of Martyrs" The Third Imam
