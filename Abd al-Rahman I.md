**Abd al-Rahman I** was a member of the Umayyad ruling family of Syria who founded an Umayyad dynasty in Spain.

When the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyad caliphate in 750 CE and sought to kill as many members of the Umayyad family as possible, Abd al-Rahman fled, eventually reaching Spain. The Iberian Peninsula had for some time been occupied by Muslim Arab forces, and he recognized political opportunity for himself in the rivalries of the Ways and Yaman, the dominant Arab factions there. 

By shifting alliances and using mercenary support, he placed himself in a position of power, attacking and defeating the governor of Al-Andalus in 755 and making [[Cordoba]] his capital.
