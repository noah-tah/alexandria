sleep


Today i am writing about what i need to do today. Today i am hungover and had too much to drink last night. I feel concerningly bad, especially considering i acutally felt pretty good leading up to the drinking last night. Before I was feeling good however I was very sick and actually puking after I awoke from my nap yesterday. I was experience some serious stomach issues from being too unhealthy in my food choices. After hearing that I ask myself why I chose to drink anyways after such an experience. It goes to show I have no regard for my personal health and how it impacts the people around me and I seriously need to get my act together.

I seriously need to consider the fact that me feeling like shit doesn't just affect me, it actually affects my beautiful children as well because I can't show up for them in the way thatthey need and as uncomplainingly as possible. I seriously need to get my act together if I ever plan to be great and make something of myself. 


I should begin focusing on harnessing my sleep and my sobriety so that I can effectively build up a tech startup and build a business. I need a business so that me and my family may become financially stable. I should look into higher-level and simpler frameworks that will allow me to build web applications rapidly so that I may quickly iterate on app ideas.

I most certainly need to make it AI-adjacent for productivity. Perharps an AI fitness tracker, that sounds like a cool idea. It would be cool if you could use AI to make the app interactive with a premium feel. Perhaps the AI assistant could ask you your details about your height weight age and fat level, and perhaps you could even upload a photo of yourself. Then we could use that data to calculate fitness goals and food suggestions tailored to the user specificallyto effectively meet these goals.
