1. Outline Content
2. Develop Full article
	1. Complete version will serve as a master document that can later be broken into smaller pieces.
3. Create shorter content for TikTok and YouTube from article sections
	1. TikTok Content:
		- Pull out "highlights" or "mini-tutorials" from each article section. Aim for quick explanations and actionable tips.
		- Each TikTok should focus on a specific concept or step, lasting around 30 seconds to 1 minute. Show the code snippet on-screen with a brief voiceover explanation.
	2. YouTube Segments:
		1. Cover a full stage per video. Since YouTube allows for more detail, you can provide additional insights or show more on-screen coding.
		2. Each video should be around 5-10 minutes long, which is long enough to explain each concept without overwhelming the viewer.
4. Format the Full Markdown Article for Posting
	- Once you've made the TikTok's and YouTube videos, finalize the markdown article in Obsidian for sharing. You can post this as a GitHub README or Medium article, or even on your own website if you have one.
	- Add links to the relevant TikTok's and YouTube videos at the end of each article section, making it easy for readers to switch to the video content if they want a different format.
5. Recycle and Repurpose for Multiple Platforms
	- After publishing the TikTok's and YouTube videos you can promote each one on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Reddit, linking back to the full article.
	- Consider a summary TikTok or YouTube video at the end of the project, recapping the entire process and encouraging viewers to check out the full article for details.
