# The Man in the Arena
---

The poorest way to face life is to face it with a sneer. There are many men who feel a kind of twisted pride in cynicism; There are many who confine themselves to critisism of the way others do what they themselves dare not even to attempt.

There is no more unhealthy being, no man less worthy of respect, than he who either really holds, or feigns to hold, an attitude of sneering disbelief toward all that is great and lofty, whether in achievement or in that noble effort which, even if it fails, comes to second achievement

It is not the critic who counts; not the main who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds coukld have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. 
	- Teddy Roosevelt (1858-1919)

In your opinion, what is the most effective method for changing society-voting, challenges in the courts, nonviolent civil disobedience, or violence? What evidence can you provide from actual events in the 1960s to support your argument?

The most effective method for changing society in modern times in my opinion is definitely nonviolent civil disobedience. The use of nonviolent disobedience was shown to be highly effective in the 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, where several groups who faced systematic discrimination and injustice used nonviolence to bring about meaningful change. 

Some examples of nonviolent disobedience in the 1960s include the six-month Greensboro "sit-in",  which set a powerful precendent, inspiring the following "sleep-ins" and "pray-ins". 

These examples of nonviolence are so effective because they create a irefutable moral high ground, which makes the justification of violence and oppression nearly impossible. When a peaceful protestor is met withj brutality, it clearly exposes injustice which will tug on the morals of public opinion, which will spark change and support for the cause among morally sound individuals 

However, I would like to highlight that history shows that sometimes under tyrannical regimes, after all roads to peaceful change have been closed, vioence and rebellion have proven to be the only means to achieve freedom and justice. So, while nonviolent civil disobedience is the most effective method for societal change in our modern democatric society, there is still a place for violence and rebellion as a last resort to end oppression under tyrannical regimes, and we shouldn't be too quick to deem it as an ineffective method.
