#quotes

The poorest way to face life is to face it with a sneer. There are many men who feel a kind of twisted pride in cynicism; There are many who confine themselves to critisism of the way others do what they themselves dare not even to attempt.

There is no more unhealthy being, no man less worthy of respect, than he who either really holds, or feigns to hold, an attitude of sneering disbelief toward all that is great and lofty, whether in achievement or in that noble effort which, even if it fails, comes to second achievement

It is not the critic who counts; not the main who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds coukld have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause
