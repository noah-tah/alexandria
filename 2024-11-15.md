# The Man in the Arena
---

The poorest way to face life is to face it with a sneer. There are many men who feel a kind of twisted pride in cynicism; There are many who confine themselves to critisism of the way others do what they themselves dare not even to attempt.

There is no more unhealthy being, no man less worthy of respect, than he who either really holds, or feigns to hold, an attitude of sneering disbelief toward all that is great and lofty, whether in achievement or in that noble effort which, even if it fails, comes to second achievement

It is not the critic who counts; not the main who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds coukld have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. 
	- Teddy Roosevelt (1858-1919)

How did the Mongols influence the world through their accomplisments and contributions?

The Mongol Empire, led by figures such as Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan, expanded across Asia and into Europe, becoming the largest contiguous land empire in history. While they are often remembered for their fierce military tactics, the Mongols also made significant contributions to global trade, culture, and governance.

Consider the following questions as you respond:
- What were some of the Mongols' most significant accomplishments in terms of governance, military innovation, and cultural exchange?
- How did the Mongol Empire impact the development of trade routses, like the Silk Road, and the echange of ideas, technology, and culture across religions?
- In what ways did the Mongol rule facilitate or hinder cultural diversity and tolerance?
- How might the Mongols' contributions still affect modern society today?
Use specific examples to support your answer, and feel free to discuss how the Mongol legacy is viewed differently across various cultures and histories.
